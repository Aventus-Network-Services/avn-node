Aventus Network belongs to the new generation of composable blockchain networks built for scalability and interoperability ðŸš€. It is capable of high transaction throughput, provides deterministic finality, low and predictable transaction costs. The network currently operates as a layer-2 to Ethereum, and is used by several production applications.

## Open Sourcing
