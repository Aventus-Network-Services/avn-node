Aventus Network belongs to the new generation of composable blockchain networks built for scalability and interoperability 🚀. It is capable of high transaction throughput, provides deterministic finality, low and predictable transaction costs. The network currently operates as a layer-2 to Ethereum, and is used by several production applications.

## Open Sourcing

The purpose of this repo is to gradually open-source the Aventus code and also give the community the opportunity to contribute to the Aventus codebase either by providing enhancements to the already available code or contributing new pallets.

We are very keen on community engagement and contributions.
